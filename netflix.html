            The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give
            parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows and movies
            in their own space.

            <br /><br />Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls
            that let you restrict the maturity rating of content kids can watch
            and block specific titles you don’t want kids to see.
